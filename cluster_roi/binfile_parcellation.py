# binfile_parcellate( infile, outfile, K ):
#
# This function performs normalized cut clustering on the connectivity matrix
# specified by infile into sets of K clusters.
#    infile:  .NPY or .bin file containing a representation of the connectivity
#             matrix to be clustered. This file contains a single vector of
#             length 3*N, in which the first N values correspond to the i
#             indices, the second N values correspond to the j indices and the
#             last N values correspond to the weights w_ij of the similarity
#             matrix W. For more information on constructing the input files
#             refer to make_local_connectivity_tcorr.py,
#             make_local_connectivity_scorr.py or
#             make_local_connectivity_ones.py.
#    outfile: a prefix for the output file, this name will be suffixed by
#             _K.npy where K corresponds to the clustering level
#    K:       list of numbers of clusters that will be generated. If this is a
#             single number then only that clustering will be generated. If
#             this is a list of numbers, then the normalized cut algorithm will
#             be run several times, once for each k in the list, and a seperate
#             output file will be generated for each clustering
